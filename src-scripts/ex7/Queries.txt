// Example queries to run after loading src-scripts/ex7/SparkSQL.scala

// Unfortunately, SparkSQL's SQL dialect doesn't support joins
// of more than two tables. So, the following won't work:
val tab1 = sql("""
  SELECT f.origin, a.airport, f.dest, b.airport, f.c2
  FROM flights_between_airports f
  JOIN airports a ON f.origin = a.iata
  JOIN airports b ON f.dest = b.iata""")

// However, a nested query to do the first join will work:
val tab2 = sql("""
  SELECT fa.origin, fa.airport, fa.dest, b.airport, fa.c2
  FROM (
    SELECT f.origin, a.airport, f.dest, f.c2
    FROM flights_between_airports f
    JOIN airports a ON f.origin = a.iata) fa
  JOIN airports b ON fa.dest = b.iata""")

print("tab2", tab2)

val tab3 = sql("""
  SELECT *
  FROM flights f
  JOIN planes p ON f.tailNum = p.tailNum
  LIMIT 100""")

print("tab3", tab3)
