# README for src-scripts

This directory tree contains examples that are Scala "script" files. They can be loaded into the Scala REPL using the `:load path/to/file` command. These files are not compiled in the usual way, which is why they are in a separate `src-scripts` directory and not the `src` directory tree. For convenience when loading, they also don't have the full directory paths the latter files have.
